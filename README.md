Implemented Logistic Regression Model for Breast Cancer Diagnosis

- Loaded and preprocessed the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset.
- Dropped irrelevant columns ('id', 'Unnamed: 32') and mapped 'diagnosis' to binary values (Malignant: 1, Benign: 0).
- Split the data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.
- Applied standard scaling to features to improve model performance.
- Trained a Logistic Regression model (max_iter=10000).
- Achieved 97% accuracy on the test set with high precision and recall.
- Generated confusion matrix and classification report for detailed model evaluation.
